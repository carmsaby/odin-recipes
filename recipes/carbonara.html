    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Carbonara: a must-try Italian dish originating from Rome, the capital city.</p>
    <p>A delicious spaghetti dish made with crispy bacon and a creamy egg sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients for 4 person</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti - 300g</li>
        <li>Guanciale - 100g</li>
        <li>Pecorino - 30g</li>
        <li>Eggs - 4</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper - to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water to cook pasta</li>
        <li>Cut the guanciale in small pieces and put them in a pan on the stove (no need to add oil, it will fry in its own fat) </li>
        <li>Break the eggs and separate the eggs yolks from the whites (you won't need this lasts, you can use them to have an healthy breakfast tomorrow). Put the yolks in a bowl with pecorino, salt and pepper, and mix</li>
        <li>When the pasta is almost ready, take it off the heat, drain it and add it in the pan with the guanciale (before this you can save a few crispy guanciale's bites for later, you can use them to decorate the final dish! Maybe not in front of an Italian)</li>
    </ol>
